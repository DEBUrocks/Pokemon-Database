I used Turbo C++ 3.1 Compiler

But this project can be run on any C++ compiler using the default set of libraries.

Introduction
What Are Pokémon?
Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside
humans. For the most part, Pokémon do not speak except to utter their names.
Pokémon are raised and commanded by their owners (called “Trainers”). During their
adventures, Pokémon grow and become more experienced and even, on occasion,
evolve into stronger Pokémon. There are currently more than 700 creatures that inhabit
the Pokémon universe.


Since there are a large number of Pokémon, one would need a lot of time to study each
one of them. There needs to be a more systematic method to undertake the studies of
Pokémon since it’s impossible otherwise to understand each one’s uniqueness.


My project therefore is a small attempt to make this task a bit easier. My project helps to
organise the large number of Pokémon. Various basis can be used to classify
Pokémon, for example, their name, Hit-points (in simple terms the health), their unique
Pokémon Pokédex Number or the fact that they are issued or not.
Using my program, Pokémon records can be added, edited, sorted, displayed, issue
them and search them based on various criterion
